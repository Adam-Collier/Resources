# Markdown Standard Guidelines
Organising the look and feel of the markdown docs.

Please, use a markdown previewer to see whether the document, written for the user is appropriately presented. With correct:

- Spacing
- Font Size

## Spaces In Between Titles

You need to include 

<space> 
   + 
 </br> 
   +

 Between each each title; when viewed from the preview or on Github, it will look much cleaner; even though in the .md it doesn't. The difference is seen below

## Bold Titles

 Are required, if we need add additional context to the title. Such as

 Or via `-`
